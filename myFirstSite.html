        <h4>A bit about me and why I work this way…</h4>
        My professional experience to date has been incredibly varied. This gives me a well-rounded skill set with the advantage over those spending several years on just one path. I’ve taken my time to get to know myself better, understand what I need from my work, how to play to my strengths and build on the areas of opportunity I know I can find more challenging.
        <h2>Reasons to work with me...</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Celebrating my differences
                <main>I have Anxiety Disorder which isn’t without its challenges for me but also comes with huge advantages - organisation and attention to detail are second nature to me. This makes me thorough in my work and easily able to mitigate risk - as my brain will always jump to the worst-case scenario and ensure I’m prepared!
                    My design background has made me a creative problem-solver but ironically my Obsessive Compulsive and Autistic traits mean I do equally well implementing systems and processes. I thrive working with organisations where the differences I bring to the table are seen as an asset and can be used as an advantage against our competitors. </main>
            <li>Professional passions
                <main>My main takeaway from my career to date has been a passion for people. Teams I’ve managed describe me as generous with my time with a deep understanding of what people really need. I’ve been told I’m a fair manager and great mentor who’s approachable, supportive and creates an inclusive workplace.

                    Some people would regard me as highly sensitive. I feel deeply, sense things others don’t and want to do the right thing for others - which I see as no bad thing.
                    
                    I’m passionate about implementing practical workable solutions to improve an experience for a customer and results for an organisation. I want to be able to make a difference and I’m not afraid to put in hard work to make it happen.</main>
            <li> Self-taught skills
                <main>I’m used to standing up in front of audiences. I taught myself to sing and play guitar, performing regularly at public events so presenting to rooms of people will never phase me.

                    I’m disciplined in all areas of my life completing three marathon distance events and over 20 half marathons raising money for charity whilst benefiting my own physical and mental wellbeing. I’m also an MHFA champion (Mental Health First Aid). </main>
            <li> What I want
                <main>I’m happiest working for purpose driven organizations as I find it difficult to compromise my morals. Henry Ford once said, “Quality is doing it right even when no one is looking.” This is the best way to describe my attitude to work.

                    I’ve never been in a better position to achieve great things for myself, my clients and the organisations I represent. </main>
        </ol>
